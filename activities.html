                                <p>NDDB launched semen station in 1976 which has grown to become a pioneer in the field
                                    with a technologically advanced
                                    processing laboratory. During 2021-22, the station produced 14.5 million semen doses
                                    and sold 19.2 million semen doses,
                                    which are the highest for any semen station in the country. Semen doses were also
                                    exported to countries like Vietnam,
                                    United Arab Emirates, Nepal, Egypt, Kenya and Bangladesh.</p>
                                <p>Over the last four decades, Sabarmati Ashram Gaushala has remained the major supplier
                                    of quality frozen semen doses of
                                    indigenous breeds in the country. The semen doses are supplied to agencies involved
                                    in improvement and multiplication of
                                    these breeds. During 2021-22, the organization produced and sold around 33.4 lakh
                                    semen doses of different indigenous
                                    breeds.
